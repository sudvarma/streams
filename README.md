# streams

Stream is a continuous flow of data through a pipeline. These data could be originated from various data sources and moving towards other data sinks. There are rich set of APIs available to process this data and to generate meaningful insights from this data. Unlike the traditional ETL where insights were generated once the data is at rest. Streams API allows to analyze the data while in transit - there by making it more real-time.
